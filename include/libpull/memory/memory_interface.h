 * The implementation is mandatory as it is used by the library to
 * interact with the memory of the device.
 * 
 * The mem_object_t type is not defined in the library and must
 * be defined by the memory implementation used to the library.
 * For this reason every time a function that requires to work
 * with memory is called, it must be also passed to it a
 * an allocated memory object. This can be done allocating it
 * statically or dinamically, depending on the platform uonstraints.
